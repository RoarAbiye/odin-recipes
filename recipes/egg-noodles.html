<p>
  This egg noodle recipe is basic and old-fashioned, just like grammy used to make! 
  Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh 
  pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your
  electric mixer or your hands to knead the pasta dough.
